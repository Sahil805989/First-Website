                    <b>Starfish</b>, or sea star, is a common marine animal found from seashore to ocean depths;
                    <b>1600</b> species are known worldwide. They belong to the invertebrate <b>phylum echinodermata</b>.
                    Starfish are usually radially <i>symmetrical</i>, often with<b> 5 radiating arms</b> joined to a
                    central disc.
                    <!-- Additional content -->
                    Although feeding habits are varied, starfish are often formidable predators which generate frantic
                    escape behaviour in snails and bivalve prey. There are many species on Canada's coasts, ranging in size
                    from tiny (50 mm) Leptasterias hexactis to giant Pycnopodia helianthoides, up to 1 m in diameter and
                    with as many as 24 arms. (Starfish, n.d.)

                    Starfish, often known as sea stars, are intriguing marine animals found in a range of aquatic
                    settings. They can be found in both shallow and deep waters, from the tropics to the poles. Starfish
                    are benthic organisms, meaning they reside on the ocean floor, and they may adapt to a variety of
                    surfaces, including rocks, coral reefs, sandy bottoms, and seagrass beds.
                    <!-- Additional content -->
                    Starfish have radial symmetry and normally have five limbs, though some species have more. Their
                    distinct water vascular system aids movement and eating. Starfish are opportunistic feeders, eating
                    a variety of foods such as mollusks, tiny fish, and debris.
                    <!-- More content -->
                    These hardy organisms are well-adapted to a variety of climatic conditions, including intertidal zones
                    where they may be exposed to air. <br><br><br>(mlblevins, 2011)

                    Starfish, often known as sea stars, exhibit fascinating behaviors in their many surroundings. They
                    travel slowly around surfaces by using tube feet. Their unique feeding method incorporates evertible
                    stomachs, which allow them to ingest and digest meals outside of their bodies. Notably, starfish have
                    the unique capacity to regrow lost arms, which is an important part of their resilience.
                    <!-- More content -->
                    Some starfish use autotomy to avoid predators by shedding arms as a diversion. They have a basic sense
                    of direction and can tell the difference between light and dark. Skin gills help with respiration and
                    osmoregulation, as well as salt balance. Starfish, which reproduce dioeciously, play an important
                    role in marine ecosystems by managing prey numbers.

                    Their slow movement is in stark contrast to their critical role in nutrient cycle. In a variety of
                    ocean environments, ranging from intertidal zones to deep-sea habitats. (Starfish Behavior -

                    Starfish (also known as sea stars) are stunning aquatic organisms that come in a range of colors,
                    shapes, and sizes. Although the most common starfish have only five arms, some of these species can
                    develop to have up to 40 arms. The remarkable sea critters, which are classified as echinoderms,
                    navigate using their tube feet. They have remarkable stomachs that allow them to recover damaged limbs
                    and consume huge prey.

                    <!-- More content -->
                    Although sea stars are usually referred to as "starfish," they are not actual fish. They lack gills,
                    scales, and fins, as do fish.
                    <!-- More content -->
                    Sea stars move very differently than fish. While fish use their tails to push themselves, sea stars
                    use tiny tube feet to propel themselves.
                    <!-- More content -->
                    Scientists prefer to refer to starfish as "sea stars" because they are not classified as fish."<br><br>

                    <b class="h1">Sea Stars Are Echinoderms:</b><br>
                    <!-- More content -->
                    The phylum Echinodermata includes sea stars. They're linked to sand dollars, sea urchins, sea
                    cucumbers, and sea lilies. This phylum has roughly 7,000 species in total.
                    <!-- More content -->
                    Many echinoderms have radial symmetry, which means that their body components are organized around a
                    central axis. Because their bodies are divided into five pieces, many sea stars feature five-point
                    radial symmetry. This means they don't have a clear left and right half, merely a top and a bottom.
                    Spines are also common in echinoderms, albeit they are less prominent in sea stars than in other
                    species such as sea urchins.<br><br>

                    <!-- More content -->
                    There are over 2,000 different types of sea stars. Some reside in the intertidal zone, while others
                    live in deep ocean water. While many species reside in tropical environments, sea stars can also be
                    found in frigid environments, including the polar regions.<br><br>

                    <b class="h1">Not All Sea Stars Have Five Arms:</b><br>
                    <!-- More content -->
                    While many people are familiar with five-armed sea stars, not all sea stars have only five arms. Some
                    species have many more arms than others, such as the sun star, which can have up to 40.
                    <!-- More content -->
                    The majority of sea stars' important organs are housed in their arms. This means that some species can
                    regenerate an entire new sea star from a single arm and a part of the central disc. This won't happen
                    overnight; it takes around a year for an arm to regenerate.<br><br>

                    <!-- More content -->
                    The skin of a sea star can be leathery or slightly spiky, depending on the species. Sea stars have a
                    strong coating on their upper side comprised of calcium carbonate plates with small spines on their
                    surface.
                    <!-- More content -->
                    The spines of a sea star protect it from predators such as birds, fish, and sea otters. The
                    crown-of-thorns starfish is a very spiky sea star.<br><br>

                    <b class="h1">Sea Stars Do Not Have Blood:</b><br>
                    <!-- More content -->
                    Sea stars have a circulatory system that is mostly made up of seawater rather than blood.
                    <!-- More content -->
                    Through the sieve plate, seawater is pushed into the animal's water circulatory system. This is a trap
                    door known as a madreporite, which is often apparent as a light-colored area on the starfish's top.
                    <!-- More content -->
                    Seawater moves into the sea star's tube foot from the madreporite, causing the arm to lengthen. To
                    retract the limb, muscles within the tube feet are employed.<br><br>
